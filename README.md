Qt projects. Qt must be set in the way enabling "Run in terminal" option.

- **Jordan**: Gaussian elimination with choice of principal element by row for solving systems of linear equations. Part of the project is my own handmade library for working with matrices, including overridden arithmetic operators and many useful function.
- **Jordan_threads**: Same stuff that is done in the **Jordan** project, however now I use library <pthread.h> to solve this problem much faster introducing several threads.
- **Jordan_threads**: Same as **Jordan_threads**, but now I use MPI instead of <pthread.h> for parallel computing.
